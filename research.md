# Research
My current research focuses on developing optimization algorithms that enhance human-AI collaboration for equitable resource allocation in high-stakes decision-making. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with optimization techniques, I aim to create iterative frameworks that combine algorithmic speed with human expertise to refine policies. Some of my current projects include
- Multi-armed bandit algorithms for human-AI collaboration
- Intersecting optimization with policymaking in healthcare, energy, technology integration, and resource allocation
- Optimization for resource allocation under fairness constraints

Past research topics included sequential decision-making and optimizing equitable wildfire resilience policy.
